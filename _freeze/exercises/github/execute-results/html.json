There are a lot of files and folders here, the main files you will use are in the **exercises** and **solutions** folders. \n\n    ![](../images/git-exercise-homescreen.png)\n\n## Copy the repo url\n\n* Click on the <span style=\"background-color:#238636; color:white; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px\">{{<fa code>}} Code</span> button and copy-paste the **HTTPS** url to your clipboard.\n\n    ![](../images/git-exercise-clone.png)\n\n## Use the repo url to create a new project in RStudio\n\n* In RStudio, create a new project by clicking in the top-right hand corner and selecting **New Project...**\n\n    ![](../images/git-exercise-new-project.png)\n\n* Select **Version Control** then **Git**. \n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Choose Version Control](../images/git-exercise-version-control.png)\n\n![Then choose Git](../images/git-exercise-git.png)\n:::\n\n* Paste your repo url in the **Repository URL** field.\n\n    ![](../images/git-exercise-paste-url.png)\n\n* The **Project directory name** will be the name of the folder on your laptop so choose something sensible, e.g. **Materials**.\n\n* Finally, select the field **Create project as subdirectory of**. This is where the Materials folder will be stored on your laptop. If you move the folder later it will break the link with GitHub, that can be fixed but it is easier to just choose somewhere sensible now. \n\n<hr>\n<br>\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n\n## Checkpoint\n\nIf you have successfully completed this step you should see the name of your project in RStudio\n\n![](../images/git-exercise-project-name.png)\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n\n# Practice the git add-commit-push workflow\n\nTo complete this exercise you will write a short \"code\" file that summarises your favourite snack. There are three necessary bits of information to include in this file: \n\n1. The name of the snack\n2. The ingredients\n3. The preparation instructions\n\nAfter you add each bit of information you will run through the complete git add-commit-push cycle, and confirm that you can see the changes to your File pushed to GitHub. \n\n\n::: {.aside}\n\nOur analytic code files are essentially lists of instructions, just like a recipe! \n\n:::\n\n## Open the practice file\n\nUsing the RStudio **Files** Pane, navigate to the folder **exercises/1-code** and open the file `0-practice-git-workflow.txt`\n\n![Navigate to exercises/1-code/0-practice-git-workflow.txt and open the file](../images/git-exercise-file-open.png)\n\nThe file should look like this.

Some say 'pil pil' is the sound of popping garlic as it cooks in the hot oil.\n\n[flawlessfood.co.uk/gambas-pil-pil/](https://flawlessfood.co.uk/gambas-pil-pil/)\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='0-practice-git-workflow.txt'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# My favourite snack\nGambas Pil Pil (Garlic and Chilli Prawns)\n\n# Ingredients\n\n\n# Instructions\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## git add the file\n\nIn the RStudio Git Pane, tick the box next to the `0-practice-git-workflow.txt`.
