Here you can write R code to clean, analyse, and visualise data [@cr-myimage]{pan-to=\"30%, 20%\" scale-by=\"1.5\"}\n\nNotice that this file is saved with a proper file name `analysis.R` so we can open and close the file and come back to the code as needed. [@cr-myimage]{pan-to=\"60%, 80%\" scale-by=\"2\"}\n\nThis area has several tabs. The **Environment** tab plays a key role in managing and visualizing the objects that exist in the current R session. [@cr-myimage]{pan-to=\"-30%, 40%\" scale-by=\"1.5\"}\n\nVarious types of objects can exist in your environment, for example vectors, dataframes and lists.\n\nCurrently we can see the `cars` dataset and the `meanSpeed` value stored in the environment.\n\nNotice the **Git** tab is also in this area. We'll use that later.\n\n\nThere are several important tabs in the bottom right-hand corner [@cr-myimage]{pan-to=\"-30%, -40%\" scale-by=\"1.5\"}\n\nThe **Files** tab shows us all the file in our project. Spot `analsis.R`!\n\nFrom here we can open files or navigate to different folders. \n\nOther important tabs in this area includes the **Plots** tab, where are plots will appear, and the **Packages** tab that has a list of all the installed packages.\n\nHere we have the console. [@cr-myimage]{pan-to=\"30%, -40%\" scale-by=\"1.5\"}\n\nThe console allows you to run R commands interactively. You can type a command directly into the console and press Enter to execute it and view the results straight away. \n\nThe console keeps track of previously executed commands. You can use the {{< fa arrow-up >}} up and {{< fa arrow-down >}} down arrow keys to scroll through past commands, making it easy to re-run commands or modify and execute them again.\n\nWorking in the console is convenient for quick, interactive commands, but it doesn't save a persistent record of your entered commands so important code should always be saved in a script.\n\nFinally, note this icon in the top right-hand corner. This tells us we are working in an R Project named `cars-study`.

Enter `getwd()` at the console to see your current working directory. Make a note of this location.\n\n2.
