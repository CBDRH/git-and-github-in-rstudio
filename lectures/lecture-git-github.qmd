## `Git` and `GitHub` in RStudio {.title-slide}

<img src="../images/github-mark-white.png"></img>

## The Challenge

As data analysts, we produce a lot of files

* code 
* figures 
* tables 
* reports 

Organising these files is an important, albeit often unglamorous, part of our job.  

## The Challenge

::: {.incremental}

* **Managing versions** What do you do with old code? 

* **Ensuring reproducibility** Can others reproduce your results? What about your future self? 

* **Facilitating collaboration** Can other team members easily contribute?

:::

## The old school solution ðŸ›µ {.smaller}

The old school solution combines many practical strategies:

::: {.incremental}
* Using file naming conventions to track different file versions 

    * analysis-16may2025.R 
    * analysis-19may2025-mh.R 
    * analysis-final.R 
    * analysis-final-final.R

* Note changes directly in code comments or separate documentation

* Use shared folders, google drive etc 

* Share code and code snippets over email, slack etc

:::


## The old school solution ðŸ›µ

> This is ok(ish) for 1-2 people working on a small project. But if the project is **large**, involves **many people** or goes on for a **long time** this approach very quickly breaks down 

## The new school solution ðŸš€

The new school solution is to use dedicated **version control software**. 

There are a few options out there but by far the most popular choice is the combination of **git** + **GitHub**

## Yes!! It is definitely worth it!

1. **Version control** | Essential for reproducibility

1. **Collaboration** | [OpenSAFELY](https://github.com/opensafely), [OHDSI](https://github.com/OHDSI/Atlas), [R package development](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse)

1. **Organisation** | e.g. Code, data & outputs all stored together

1. **Easy web presence** | e.g. any public GitHub repo; these slides! 

1. **Great for teaching** 

1. **Powerful search** 

1. **Issue tracking** | Hyperlink the bug, discussion about the bug & the solution!

1. **It is all _free_\***

# Key concepts

## Key concept: R Projects

## Key concept: Relative paths with `here::here()`

1. Make sure you are working in the R Project you created earlier <span><img src="/images/project-exercise1.png" height="28pts" style="vertical-align: middle;"/></span> 

1. Enter `here::here()` at the console to see your current working directory. This should be where you saved your project!

1. Enter `here::here(".gitignore")` at the console. What happens?

1. Enter `file.exists(here::here(".gitignore"))` at the console. This should return `TRUE`. Note that you don't need the full path to locate the file! 

:::
::::

::: {.figLab}
**Note** We will talk more about what the `.gitignore` file actually does later

## Key concept: Repository 

:::: {.columns}

:::

::: {.column}

### A repository is where the magic happens {{<fa wand-magic-sparkles >}}

* Referred to as a **repo* **
* 1 git project = 1 repo
* Database of changes to your code (aka _diffs_)
* Hidden folder on your system named **.git**

:::

## Key concept: Commit 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

![](../images/commit-diagram.png)

:::

::: {.column}

### Commit

* A Commit is like clicking save in a MS Word document 

* It saves a snapshot of the code at that point in time 

* Why you commit you must write a message explaining what changed

* Committing is a two stage process - more on this later

:::

::::

## Key concept: Staging area

You can only commit files that have been `added to the staging area`

. . .

::: {.incremental}

There are a few advantages to breaking commits into two steps:

* You can split a big edit into bite-sized pieces 

* Easier to review

* If you make a mistake you can _unstage_. You can't un-commit!

1. In the Git panel, tick the box next to `recipe.txt` to add the file to the staging area <i class="fa-solid fa-camera"></i>

1. Click the commit icon <span><img src="/images/commit-icon.png" height="28pts" style="vertical-align: middle;"/></span> to commit the file. Add a sensible message then click **Commit** <i class="fa-solid fa-camera"></i>

:::
::::


## Key concept: The `.gitignore` file

You can tell git to ignore specific files and folders by listing them in a special file: `.gitignore`

. . . 

The default `.gitignore` file for R projects list files that are specific to your configuration---these are personal so we don't want to share them. 

```
.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata
```

. . . 

`.gitignore` also recognises patterns: 

 
* `*.xlsx` (ignore all xlsx files)
* `*.Rda` (ignore all .Rda files)
* `/Data` (ignore everything in the folder named Data)

:::

::: {.column width=75%}

1. Make sure you are working in the R Project you created earlier <span><img src="/images/project-exercise1.png" height="28pts" style="vertical-align: middle;"/></span> 

1. Create and save a new file `private.txt` (File > New File > Text File). Git should automatically detect the new file so you should see the file appear in the git panel. 

1. Open the `.gitignore` file and add the text `private.txt` on a new line. Click save.

Once you ignore the file it is no longer being tracked and it should disappear from the git panel.

## Key Concept: Fork

To `fork` a repo means to take a copy of the repo on GitHub

## Key Concept: Clone

<!-- Mini Exercise 4. Clone a remote repo -->

## Mini-Exercise

### Clone a remote repo


**A note on this exercise:** In this exercise you will clone a remote repo from GitHub to your local RStudio. The example uses a repo from the [tame](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.24.24309427v2) R package for identifying clusters of medication use based on dose, timing and type of medication published by Anna Laksafoss from the University of Copenhagen. You will use Git's powerful search function to find this repo but **note you can do this exercise with any repo you like!**

1. Launch the RStudio New Project Wizard, but this time select **Version Control** then **Git** 

1. Paste the HTTPS url into the **Repository URL** box and specify a sensible subdirectory location for this new repo <i class="fa-solid fa-camera"></i>

1. Optionally tick âœ…  **Open in new session** then select **Create Project**

## Workflow

## Workflow

How you actual perform these commands depends on the git client you are using...

. . . 

We will use the RStudio Interface

![](../images/rstudio-pane.png)




# Frequently asked questions 

## What files can I track?  

. . . 

This all works best for non-binary or text files e.g. your typical code files (.sas, .do, .R, .Rmd, .py) but also .png, .csv etc

You can include non-binary files (.pdf, .docx, .xlsx etc) in a git repo but the diff features won't work. It can still be useful if using the repo as a central organisation point (e.g. if you save your published manuscript with the analysis code). 


## How often should I commit? 

. . . 

Well, it depends.

Just like when you start writing a word document you might not click save very often as you spew out lots of ideas, but at the end of your thesis you will carefully save every change! 

It is best practice to keep commits fairly small and related, especially for mature projects. 



## What about my sensitive data/code? 

. . . 

::: {incremental}
* If your data are sensitive be very careful not to track with Git 

* Private repos are available if you don't want the public to see your code (you can change to public later if desired.)

* Git Hosting Services like Gitea are available in secure analysis environments (SURE/ERICA etc)
:::


## How does my repo align with my project folder?

. . . 

* You need to actively think about this!

* Option: Root folder of the project

* Option: Specific folder (e.g. just `Code/`)

* Git ignores files and folders listed in the special `.gitignore` file

# Any other questions?
