    "text": "We’re going to spend two days working on R code so let’s take a moment to open up RStudio to orientate ourselves.\n\n\n\n\nHere is a snapshot of the RStudio environment.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a lot going on!\n\n\n\n\nLet’s break it down.\n\n\n\n\nThis is an R script file (.R extension). Here you can write R code to clean, analyse, and visualise data\n\n\n\n\nNotice that this file is saved with a proper file name analysis.R so we can open and close the file and come back to the code as needed.\n\n\n\n\nThis area has several tabs. The Environment tab plays a key role in managing and visualizing the objects that exist in the current R session.\n\n\n\n\nVarious types of objects can exist in your environment, for example vectors, dataframes and lists.\n\n\n\n\nCurrently we can see the cars dataset and the meanSpeed value stored in the environment.\n\n\n\n\nNotice the Git tab is also in this area. We’ll use that later.\n\n\n\n\nThere are several important tabs in the bottom right-hand corner\n\n\n\n\nThe Files tab shows us all the file in our project. Spot analsis.R!\n\n\n\n\nFrom here we can open files or navigate to different folders.\n\n\n\n\nOther important tabs in this area includes the Plots tab, where are plots will appear, and the Packages tab that has a list of all the installed packages.\n\n\n\n\nHere we have the console.\n\n\n\n\nThe console allows you to run R commands interactively. You can type a command directly into the console and press Enter to execute it and view the results straight away.\n\n\n\n\nThe console keeps track of previously executed commands. You can use the  up and  down arrow keys to scroll through past commands, making it easy to re-run commands or modify and execute them again.\n\n\n\n\nWorking in the console is convenient for quick, interactive commands, but it doesn’t save a persistent record of your entered commands so important code should always be saved in a script.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, note this icon in the top right-hand corner. This tells us we are working in an R Project named cars-study."
