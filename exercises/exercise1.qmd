_**Overview:** You already have a repo named `Exercise1` in your local RStudio, in this exercise you will create an empty remote repo in GitHub and link it to your local repo_ 

# Create an empty repo in GitHub

## Go to [github.com](https://github.com/), and click the + symbol then New repository

## Specify yourself as the owner and name the repo **Exercise 1**

**Notes**

* Optionally add a description for your repo
* You can choose Public or Private---Public repos can be viewed online by anyone. 
* Because you already have a local repo, **don't** add a README file, a .gitignore file, or a license. 
* When you are ready, click **Create Repository**. 

::: {.aside}

The remote repo name doesn't have to match your local repo or RStudio Project name, but it can be good practice to keep things organised!

## Copy the quick setup code to your clipboard

# In RStudio, link your local repo to this new remote repo

**Notes** 

* Go back to RStudio
* Open the Terminal (it's next to the console)
* Paste the code and hit Enter
* If you want to confirm it worked enter `git remote -v` at the terminal---it should return the url of your remote repo

# In the RStudio git panel, click push to push your local changes to the remote repo

**Notes**

* That's it! If you go back to GitHub and refresh the webpage you should see your `recipe.txt` file and your commit history.
